  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>How it ever came to pass that Arithmetic should be taught
to the extent attained in the grammar schools of the civilized
world, while Geometry is almost wholly excluded from them,
is a problem for which the author of this little book has
often sought a solution, but with only this result; viz., that
Arithmetic, being considered an elementary branch, is included
in all systems of elementary instruction; but Geometry, being
regarded as a higher branch, is reserved for systems of advanced
education, and is, on that account, reached by but very
few of the many who need it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The error here is fundamental. Instead of teaching the
<em>elements of all branches</em>, <em>we teach elementary branches</em> much too
exhaustively.</p>

<p class='c000'>The elements of Geometry are much easier to learn, and
are of more value when learned, than advanced Arithmetic;
and, if a boy is to leave school with merely a grammar-school
education, he would be better prepared for the active duties of
life with a <em>little</em> Arithmetic and <em>some</em> Geometry, than with
<em>more</em> Arithmetic and <em>no</em> Geometry.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thousands of boys are allowed to leave school at the age
of fourteen or sixteen years, and are sent into the carpenter-shop,
the machine-shop, the mill-wright’s, or the surveyor’s
office, stuffed to repletion with Interest and Discount, but so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>utterly ignorant of the merest elements of Geometry, that they
could not find the centre of a circle already described, if their
lives depended upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unthinking persons frequently assert that young children
are incapable of reasoning, and that the truths of Geometry
are too abstract in their nature to be apprehended by them.</p>

<p class='c000'>To these objections, it may be answered, that any ordinary
child, five years of age, can deduce the conclusion of a syllogism
if it understands the terms contained in the propositions;
and that nothing can be more palpable to the mind of a child
than forms, magnitudes, and directions.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are many teachers who imagine that the perceptive
faculties of children should be cultivated <em>exclusively</em> in early
youth, and that the reason should be addressed only at a
later period.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is certainly true that perception should receive a
larger share of attention than the other faculties during the
first school years; but it is equally certain that <em>no</em> faculty can
be safely disregarded, even for a time. The root does not
attain maturity before the stem appears; neither does the stem
attain its growth before its branches come forth to give birth
in turn to leaves; but root, stem, and leaves are found simultaneously
in the youngest plant.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the reason may be profitably addressed through the
medium of Geometry at as early an age as seven years is asserted
by no less an authority than President Hill of Harvard
College, who says, in the preface to his admirable little Geometry,
that a child seven years old may be taught Geometry more
easily than one of fifteen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The author holds that this science should be taught in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>primary and grammar schools, for the same reasons that apply
to all other branches. One of these reasons will be stated here,
because it is not sufficiently recognized even by teachers. It
is this:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The prime object of school instruction is to place in the
hands of the pupil the means of continuing his studies without
aid after he leaves school. The man who is not a student of
some part of God’s works cannot be said to live a rational life.
It is the proper business of the school to do for each branch of
science exactly what <em>is</em> done for reading.</p>

<p class='c000'>Children are taught to read, not for the sake of what is contained
in their readers, but that they may be able to read all
through life, and thereby fulfil one of the requirements of
civilized society. So, enough of each branch of science should
be taught to enable the pupil to pursue it after leaving school.</p>

<p class='c000'>If this view is correct, it is wrong to allow a pupil to reach
the age of fourteen years without knowing even the alphabet
of Geometry. He should be taught at least how to <em>read</em> it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It certainly does seem probable, that if the youth who now
leave school with so much Arithmetic, and no Geometry, were
taught the first rudiments of the science, thousands of them
would be led to the study of the higher mathematics in their
mature years, by reason of those attractions of Geometry
which Arithmetic does not possess.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>TO THE PROFESSIONAL READER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This little book is constructed for the purpose of instructing
large classes, and with reference to being used also by teachers
who have themselves no knowledge of Geometry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first statement will account for the many, and perhaps
seemingly needless, repetitions; and the second, for the <em>suggestive</em>
style of some of the questions in the lessons which <em>develop</em>
the matter contained in the review-lessons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Attention is respectfully directed to the following points:—</p>

<p class='c000'>First the particular, then the general. See page <a href='#Page_25'>25</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Why is <em>m n g</em> an acute angle?</p>

<p class='c000'>What is an acute angle?</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the attention is directed first to this particular angle;
then this is taken as an example of its kind, and the idea generalized
by describing the class. See also page <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Why are the lines <em>e f</em> and <em>g h</em> said to be parallel?</p>

<p class='c000'>When are lines said to be parallel?</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the questions are intended to test the vividness of
the pupil’s conception. See page <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Also page <a href='#Page_78'>78</a>. If the circumference were divided into 360
equal parts, would each arc be large or small?</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the questions are intended to test the attention of
the pupil.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thing is not to be recognized by the definition; but
the definition is to be a description of the thing, a description
of the conception brought to the mind of the pupil by
means of the name.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Note A<a id='nA'></a>.</span>—To those teachers who think that the line should be
derived from a surface, and the surface from a solid, the author would
say, that, according to his experience, children apprehend the ideas
conveyed by the terms <em>line</em> and <em>surface</em> as readily as they do any
ideas whatever; and that, therefore, there seems to be no necessity
for extraordinary care in this case to avoid giving wrong impressions.</p>

<p class='c012'>Still, if it be considered desirable in this manner to derive lines and
surfaces, it will be apparent that all that can be done in the matter is
to give such instruction only by way of a preliminary lesson.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Note B<a id='nB'></a>.</span>—Crooked and curved lines are here treated of before
straight lines, because the first two are defined by means of an affirmative
property,—they <em>do</em> change direction; while the last is defined
by means of the absence of one,—they do <em>not</em> change direction. It is
easier for a child to comprehend what is than what is <em>not</em>.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Note C<a id='nC'></a>.</span>—If the pupils are old enough, they may be shown that
vertical lines cannot be parallel, but only seem so on account of their
shortness and nearness to each other.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Note D<a id='nD'></a>.</span>—This definition may be considered objectionable because
<em>rhomboid</em> means like a rhomb. That the more general figure, the
rhomboid, has been named from the more restricted one, the rhomb, is
unfortunate, because it interferes with the symmetry of the nomenclature.
The rhomb possesses all the properties of the rhomboid, and
should, therefore, when these are considered, be called by the same
name; its additional property entitles it to a name which should
comprehend the other names. If the rectangle had been called a
squaroid, the difficulty would have been repeated.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Note E<a id='nE'></a>.</span>—If teachers consider it desirable, they may require the
class to prove, by way of corollary, such propositions as assert the
parallelism of the lines when the interior alternate angles are equal,
when the opposite exterior and interior angles are equal, &amp;c., in continuation
of what has already been done.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
